# peter-cortex
The PETER (Preserve Emotions in Translations for Extended Reality) project integrated into the larger project, CORTEX2. PETER is an accurate voice-to-voice translator that preserves a possible tone of urgency of the speaker. Furthermore, this translation aims to be quasi real-time by respecting a maximum latency threshold of 3 seconds. The recognition of urgency is performed while respecting the privacy of the users. 

## Project Goals
- quasi-real-time voice translation prototype that preserves emotional tone for XR 
applications.
- Achieve a maximum end-to-end latency of 3 seconds for the translation process.
- Maintain high accuracy in both translation and emotion preservation.
- Allow seamless integration with the Cortex2 framework as a server-side service.
